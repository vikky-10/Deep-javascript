ðŸ”¥ GraphQL

<!-- --------- -->
graphQL!==database  !important
 

it is use to cummunicate between client and server

ðŸ”´ it is a powerfull query language for api.
ðŸ”´ it allows for a more flexible and efficient approach than rest.
ðŸ”´ While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request.
ðŸ”´ Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.
ðŸ”´ GraphQL is self documented
ðŸ”´  get request is know as Query ant other like put, delete, post are know as mutation

in this i created application 
i you graphql server for backend 
React as frontend and node as backend


ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ¯most important thisng is that ke we are requestion to single end point "/graphql"  
for example:    
/user-------------------  /grphql
/follower---------------  /grphql
/posts------------------/graphql


there is different way to make server 
mainly we are using 2 as javascript developer one is using apolo server which i use in project1 and project 2
In this I try to implement express-graphql

âœ”âœ”ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ¯
express-graphql helps express to understand graphql it also helps express to deal with graphql api

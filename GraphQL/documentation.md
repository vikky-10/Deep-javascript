ðŸ”¥ GraphQL

<!-- --------- -->
graphQL!==database  !important
 

it is use to cummunicate between client and server

ðŸ”´ it is a powerfull query language for api.
ðŸ”´ it allows for a more flexible and efficient approach than rest.
ðŸ”´ While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request.
ðŸ”´ Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.
ðŸ”´ GraphQL is self documented
ðŸ”´  get request is know as Query ant other like put, delete, post are know as mutation

in this i created application 
i you graphql server for backend 
React as frontend and node as backend


ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ¯most important thisng is that ke we are requestion to single end point "/graphql"  
for example:    
/user-------------------  /grphql
/follower---------------  /grphql
/posts------------------/graphql


there is different way to make server 
mainly we are using 2 as javascript developer one is using apolo server which i use in project1 and project 2
In this I try to implement express-graphql

âœ”âœ”ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ¯
express-graphql helps express to understand graphql it also helps express to deal with graphql api

Q) why we wrap the field inside a function?
Ans: if we not wrap the field inside a function then when we define different types insid any object type it throw an error if we change the order of different type then also it throw an error In function what happend na order not matter.

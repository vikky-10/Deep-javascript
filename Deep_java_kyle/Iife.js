// 🏷️ IIFE 🔥

// 🔴 An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.

// EX.
// (function () {
//     statements
// })();

// It is a design pattern which is also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function and contains two major parts:

// The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator (). This prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope.
// The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression () through which the JavaScript engine will directly interpret the function.
